# Classification-evaluation
## The 5 Classification Evaluation metrics every Data Scientist must know
What do we want to optimize for? Most of the businesses fail to answer this simple question.
Every business problem is a little different, and it should be optimized differently.
We all have created classification models. A lot of time we try to increase evaluate our models on accuracy. But do we really want accuracy as a metric of our model performance?
What if we are predicting the number of asteroids that will hit the earth.
Just say zero all the time. And you will be 99% accurate. My model can be reasonably accurate, but not at all valuable. What should we do in such cases?

Designing a Data Science project is much more important than the modeling itself.

### 1. Accuracy, Precision, and Recall:
